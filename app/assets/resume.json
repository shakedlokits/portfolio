    "summary": "Armed with a triple-major for Computer Science, Education and Visual Communication at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Bezalel Academy for Arts and Design. I am very interested in utilizing interdisciplinary solutions to solve and re-design real world problems.\nComing from a difficult social-economic background I quit school early and found great interest in the symbiosis between design and engineering for it’s impact on re-designing our education. Constantly looking for better information models which could be applied to parametric and generative design solutions.\nWhen I’m not obsessing about content generation, you would usually find me sailing somewhere, motorcycling a mountain or wondering around looking for something new to eat.",
